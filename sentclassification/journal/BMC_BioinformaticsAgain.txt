Ginter [ 27 ] introduced a new family of classifiers , which were based on an ordering and weighing of the feature vectors obtained from word counts and word co-occurrence in the text .
This method was used to determine whether a term was a gene versus a protein and achieved 86 % accuracy .

RDAM is a method for identifying genes with changing expression levels using the user-determined FDR and/or S selection parameters .
This method was used to study the effects of a thermosensitive mutation of TOR2 in yeast .

We thus developed a new profile that replaces the prediction irrelevant features by hydrophobic information represented in SARAH1 scale .
This method when used in CEH-Profile showed reasonable improvement over existing profiles .

A recent publication described a supervised classification method for microarray data : Between Group Analysis ( BGA ) .
This method which is based on performing multivariate ordination of groups proved to be very efficient for both classification of samples into pre-defined groups and disease class prediction of new unknown samples .

The famous Lempel-Ziv algorithm can efficiently extract the information on repeated patterns encoded in RNA secondary structures and makes our method an alternative to analyze the similarity of RNA secondary structures .
This method will also be useful to researchers who are interested in evolutionary analysis .

Our method of gene selection will not return sets of genes that are highly correlated , because they are redundant .
This method will be most useful under two scenarios : a ) when considering the design of diagnostic tools , where having a small set of probes is often desirable ; b ) to help understand the results from other gene selection approaches that return many genes , so as to understand which ones of those genes have the largest signal to noise ratio and could be used as surrogates for complex processes involving many correlated genes .

By the method we proposed , we could determine the robust stability under intrinsic fluctuations and identify the genes that are significantly affected by extrinsic noises , which we call the weak structure of the network .
This method will be potential for robust gene circuit design in future , on which a drug design could be based .
--
The weights were normalized so the profile-profile score had a weight of one .
This method will be referred to as Prob-score-SS in the rest of the study .

In a search for putative WSSV regulatory promoter elements , we compared the abundance of all 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 or 8 nucleotide motifs in the 100 and 200 nt upstream sequences of all WSSV genes relative to their presence in the complete WSSV genomic sequence .
This method will be referred to as the enumeration method in the remaining part of the article .

We have shown that probes which target overlapping transcript sequence regions on cDNA microarrays and Affymetrix gene-chips exhibit a greater level of concordance than the corresponding Unigene or sequence matched features .
This method will be useful for the integrated analysis of gene expression data generated by multiple disparate measurement platforms .

We have presented a method to test the significance of expression changes within a group of genes , while considering the correlation structure among genes in each group .
This method will enable the rapid detection of microarray evidence indicating altered cell functions or pathways , and will facilitate the interpretation of microarray outcomes .
--
Then in each iteration , each random tree will be refined with the newly labeled examples by its concomitant ensemble , where the confidence of the labeled example exceeds a certain threshold ? .
This method will reduce the chance of the trees in a random forest being biased when we utilize the unlabeled data .
--
A conservative adjustment method ( Bonferroni 's adjustment ) is to divide the experiment-wise Type I error level ( a ) by the number of hypotheses tested ( N = 22,283 ) and use that as the cut-off for significant p-values .
This method will usually result in very few , if any , significant p-values .
--
In this study , we proposed a scoring method ( Eq. 1 ) that combined the predicted variance information to compare two spectra under total ion current normalization .
This method worked well in validating the intensity model and could be used for peptide identification .

( 3 ) Bisecting K Means ( BKM ) : The initial centroids are calculated using a variation of the Bisecting K Means algorithm [ 10 ] .
This method works by first randomly selecting one gene ( gene0 ) from the data .
--
For example , UniqueProt [ 8 ] is a fast and simple method that reduces the redundancy of the dataset by removing over-represented sequences , based on a user-defined percent identity threshold .
This method works reasonably well when the proteins have similar domain architectures .
--
The most frequent haplotypes pairs can then be assigned for each genotype in the sample .
This method works well but has limitations linked to storage requirements because the number of possible haplotypes grows exponentially with the number of loci treated .
--
In the analysis , a continuous portion of an antigen is sequentially substituted into a different sequence .
This method works well for an antibody recognizing a linear epitope , but not for that recognizing a discontinuous epitope .
--
The epitope region is narrowed down by repeating the process .
This method works well for continuous epitopes , but can not narrow down the epitope region enough in case of the discontinuous ones .
--
In the first stage , the SVM-RFE technique was most efficient and robust in the presence of low number of samples and high input space dimension .
This method yielded an optimal subset of 14 representative features , which were all related to energy and sequence motifs .

To avoid training data sparseness and to structure the hypothesis space based on the entire protein distribution , we have proposed a prediction method that uses Joachims ' spectral graph transducer and is trained on both structure-known sequences and structure-unknown sequences .
This method yielded MCCs 0.202 points higher than the MCC yielded by the method plotting hydrophobicity vs. net charge ( FoldIndex ) and 0.221 points higher than the MCC yielded by the method plotting hydrophobicity against the number of contacts .
--
The coverage can also be estimated in nucleotide numbers .
This method yields a slightly different answer than the one provided by the number of detections ( Table 4 ) .
