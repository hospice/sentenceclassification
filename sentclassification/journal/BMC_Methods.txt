By using the case of an abrupt and sustained reduction in the availability of heroin in Australia in January 2001 , we have shown that problems associated with applying standard ITSA can be overcome by : defining and dating such an event in ways that are not influenced by the outcomes to be modeled ; identifying appropriate indicator series to model ; fitting ITSA models to the data in ways that minimize the effects of researcher bias by using a prescriptive method to select functional depictions of the event and subsequently modifying these using appropriate transfer functions ; and evaluating plausible rival explanations of any changes observed in the time series so that these changes could be more confidently attributed to the unplanned event .
This method is particularly useful for unplanned and poorly understood events ( such as the heroin shortage ) which are of a size and nature that would be difficult or impossible to mimic experimentally , but whose consequences are of potentially great public health interest to researchers and policy makers .

Another issue with this method of identifying double recombinants is that if a single recombinant occurs in both siblings , and the recombinant occurs on one side of a given marker in the first sibling and on the other side of that marker in the second sibling , the two siblings could in fact share an additional allele IBD for only that single marker .
This method would have no way of distinguishing between a double recombinant and two single recombinants occurring in almost the exact same chromosomal region in two individual siblings and may account for some of the false positives that have been encountered .
